Themes: indexing algorithms and data structures
Indexing algorithms play a crucial role in improving search engine efficiency. Efficient data structures such as trees, hash tables, and registries are often used to store and retrieve data quickly. By optimizing these algorithms, developers can reduce search latency and enhance user experience. Understanding the underlying data structures is essential for implementing effective indexing methods that scale well with large datasets.
