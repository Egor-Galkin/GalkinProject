Themes: multithreading performance and code refactoring techniques
Multithreading performance is a key factor in modern software development, allowing programs to execute tasks concurrently and utilize CPU resources effectively. However, achieving optimal performance requires careful synchronization and avoiding race conditions. Code refactoring techniques help improve code readability and maintainability, making it easier to implement multithreading safely. Clean and type-safe code reduces bugs and enhances overall application stability.
